# Swiss QR Addon

This is an addon for [Docspell](https://docspell.org) to process
[Swiss QR
Code](https://www.paymentstandards.ch/dam/downloads/ig-qr-bill-en.pdf)
that appears on most invoices.

This project provides a simple cli tool to read these qr codes from
images and pdf files. It can be installed as an docspell addon to
process each (invoice) file and add the extracted information as
metadata to the document.
